Okay, let's get one thing straight: obviously, this isn't the first thing I've ever written. I mean, I'm a software engineer. There are codes I have written, documentations I have done for my crazy frontend partner who doesn't grasp things easily until we start shouting at each other, commit messages out of frustration, and even the occasional messages to my friends while catching up. But this? This is the first thing I'm tossing out into the wild on _my own personal blog_. And honestly? It feels pretty damn good to have a little corner of the internet that's all mine. I mean, this is mine! I can do whatever, say whatever, name it.

Life has been a bit of a rollercoaster lately. Honestly, I am not happy, neither am I sad. Regardless of how I am feeling or how my mental health has been lately, I've realized something: I've got stuff to say. Not just about code (though, trust me, there's plenty of that coming), but about life, the random thoughts that hit me while I'm waiting for a build to finish or while I am having crazy anxiety dealing with deadlines and my partner is offering me a bottle of water like it is going to solve bugs I have been facing for hours (smfh, do better). I've always been the type to process things by writing them down, but I never really had a spot to share it, until now. But guess who is back? That is why I had to take a few hours splited into weeks of my extremely tight schedule to set up this blog section on my portfolio. It is still very much a mess, but I know it will definitely get better.

Which brings me to why I finally slapped a blog section onto my portfolio. I have tried the whole LinkedIn thing a few times, you know? Posting “thoughtful professional” snippets or whatever. But every time I scrolled through that platform, it just felt… fake. Like, everyone’s out there polishing their personal brand, humblebragging about their “journey,” or dropping motivational quotes they probably Googled five minutes before. I would want to write something real, hit post, but then I know it would feel like I was auditioning for a role I didn’t even want. LinkedIn is cool for networking, sure, but it’s not _me_. I wanted a space where I could just vibe, write what I want, how I want, without some invisible corporate standard breathing down my neck. So here we are with this my own little digital playground.

I was playing Sudoku as usual one day, and the idea just came to me while I was brainstorming on what to put out on LinkedIn since I promised myself I would be putting one thing out at least once a month. But the idea wasn’t for LinkedIn at all; it was like, 'fck this, do it on your portfolio instead.' It took another two weeks to actually open my VS Code to my portfolio, then another two weeks to complete an implementation that would have taken me a few hours. Please don’t blame me. The culprits are procrastination and my work. I love that work so much, it’s almost like my life is on the line.

Building this blog was a fun side quest, too. I got to flex some muscles, mess around with Markdown (hi, you’re reading it now!), and make something that’s 100% mine. No algorithms to please, no character limits, no nonsense at all (maybe only my nonsense, but that’s good nonsense), just me, my keyboard, and whatever’s on my mind. And yeah, maybe it’s a little self-indulgent, but who cares? It’s _my_ portfolio, right?

So, what’s the plan? I’m gonna try to keep this thing alive with more posts. Maybe I’ll rant about something, talk about a thing I’m obsessed with, or just dump some random thoughts about life, or maybe even go crazy and share the passwords to my bank account (nothing much in it anyway). Whatever it is, I promise it’ll be real, chill, and probably a little unpolished, because that’s the good stuff. Stick around, yeah? I’d love for you to see what’s next. Hit me up, or just lurk silently (no judgment). More blog posts are coming, and I’m stoked to see where this little experiment takes me. Goodbye, stranger!

Until next time,
